# Constructor-
C++ project, worked with Yuanhao Liu and Shuchen Liu in Spring 2021.
The Constructor is a variant of the game Settlers of Catan, simplified monopoly, where four builders build residences and roads toward the winning building points. 

Within this directory, there are all codes for the program including a Makefile to compile everything. UML is also included to show all relationships and interactions between the classes.

- design.pdf discussed how we designed the program, applied various of design patterns and the how the design supports the possibility of various changes (resilience to change). 
- demo.pdf provides a thorough walkthrough of the game, where all files needed are provided within this directory, such as layout.txt and backup.txt
